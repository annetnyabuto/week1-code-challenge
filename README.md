This repository contains three projects that have been placed in different folders.
 Challenge 1 : Chai Bora Ingredient Calculator 

Project Description
This is a simple JavaScript calculator that helps users determine the amount of ingredients needed to make chai (tea). The calculator uses the standard recipe quantities provided and multiplies them according to the number of cups requested.


This project helped me practice:
1.User input handling
2.Basic arithmetic operations.
3.Console output formatting in JavaScript.

Features

  Prompts user to enter the number of chai cups.
  Calculates water, milk, tea leaves, and sugar amounts.
  Prints ingredient list to the console.

Future Improvements

- Add a web interface for better user experience.
- Allow customization of ingredient ratios.
- Include options for chai variants (e.g., less sugar, with spices).

How to Run

1. Open the `index.html` file in the browser,open the browser console.
2. When prompted, enter the number of cups of chai you want to make.
3. See the calculated ingredient amounts printed in the console.
